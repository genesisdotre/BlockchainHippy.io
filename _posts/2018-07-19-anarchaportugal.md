<p>
Anarchaportugal cross-pollinates communities in tech, philosophy, art, education and wellness to discuss what these changes mean for communities across Portugal, Europe and the World. Providing the space to nurture these connections will empower leadership, connect the dots and transmute events into movements, and vehicles for liberation.
<br>
The two-day event features more than 25 speakers, interactive workshops, dozens of exhibitions, live painting and art installments, health & wellness activities, exclusive networking events and decentralized dance parties.
